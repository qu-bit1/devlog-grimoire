## my tech notes

now as i am starting an intern at unifyapps and learning about different technologies why not document them. might come handy in times of crisis \
currently the plan is to do the following(not in any particular order)\
- [ ] mongodb
- [ ] redis
- [ ] quarkus
- [ ] gradle
- [ ] kafka
- [ ] java concepts
